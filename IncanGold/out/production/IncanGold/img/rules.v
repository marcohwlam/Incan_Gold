The expedition deck is composed of the following cards:
14 Treasure cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 11, 11, 13, 14, 15 gems)
15 Hazard cards (3 each of fire, mummy, rocks, snakes, and spiders)
5 Artifact cards
At the start of the game, all Treasure and Hazard cards are shuffled into the deck, but none of the Artifacts are in the deck.
The game is divided into five expeditions. After five expeditions, the player with the most points wins. All expeditions are played in the same fashion.
At the start of an expedition, one Artifact card is added into the deck, then the deck is shuffled. All players will start going into the expedition. Then the expedition plays in several rounds.
Each round, a card from the deck is revealed. One of the following can happen:
A Treasure card is revealed. The Treasure card shows a number of gems. Divide them equally to the players still in the expedition; any leftovers are left on the card.
A Hazard card is revealed. If it's the first Hazard card of the kind during the expedition, nothing happens. If it's the second, then the expedition fails; see below.
An Artifact card is revealed. Nothing happens.
After that, if the expedition doesn't fail yet (due to two Hazards of the same kind), each player will make a decision whether to stay in the expedition or retire back to the camp. They make the decision secretly, and the decisions are revealed simultaneously.
People that choose to retire no longer participate in the expedition. First, they take the leftover gems (the remainders when Treasure cards are revealed and not all can be divided equally). They distribute them equally among the people that retire; any leftover gems are still left on the cards. All the gems claimed during the expedition and at this time are now safe and cannot be lost. Moreover, if there is exactly one person that retires, they also take all the Artifact cards revealed during the expedition.
Once a player retires, their gems are brought into their tent. The contents of each player's tent are hidden, so it's best to memorize each player's winnings.
After this, if there are still some people in the expedition, continue with the next round. Otherwise, the expedition ends.
The expedition can end prematurely if two Hazard cards of the same kind is revealed. In this case, everyone still in the expedition gets no gems from the expedition. One of the two identical Hazard cards is removed from the deck permanently, so the rest of the game will have one less card of that kind of Hazard.
Regardless of whether an expedition ends by all people retiring or two Hazard cards of the same kind are revealed, any Artifact not claimed are removed from the deck permanently.
After five expeditions, the final scoring occurs. Each gem successfully brought back (not lost during the expedition) is worth 1 point. The Artifacts are worth 5 points each, and when collecting the last two Artifacts you get 5 extra gems. The player with the most points wins (and as tie breaker the player with the most artifacts wins).
